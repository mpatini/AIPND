Principle Objectives
    Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if breed is misclassified and which pet images aren't of dogs.
 
    Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.
 
    Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve the objectives 1 and 2.
 
    Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.

Program Outline
Repeat below for all three image classification algorithms (e.g. input algorithm as command line argument):

Time your program
    Use Time Module to compute program runtime
Get program Inputs from the user
    Use command line arguments to get user inputs
Create Pet Images Labels
    Use the pet images filenames to create labels
    Store the pet image labels in a data structure (e.g. dictionary)
Create Classifier Labels and Compare Labels
    Use the Classifier function classify the images and create the classifier labels
    Compare Classifier Labels to Pet Image Labels
    Store Pet Labels, Classifier Labels, and their comparison in a complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
Classifying Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs"
    Classify all Labels (Pet & Classifier) as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs" using dognames.txt file
    Store new classifications in the complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
Calculate the Results
    Use Labels and their classifications to determine how well the algorithm worked on classifying images.
